Having recently been working on a IoT workshop based around the [Spark Core from Spark Devices](https://www.spark.io/) (more on this later), I really wanted a nice and simple way for the attendees to have instant access to all the core commands the Spark is capable of. There are already a plethora of cheat sheets available for various other platforms, however with the Spark Core being so new, there wasn’t anything out there yet, so I thought I’d go ahead an make one myself.

Here then is my cheat sheet for the Spark Core. I hope it comes in handy for people (and do let me know if you see any errors in it).
