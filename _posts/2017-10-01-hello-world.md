As this blog is for the developer community, it seemed to make sense to start with a **hello world** :)

We'll hopefully have more articles to add real soon, but untill then we just wanted to say hello and to watch this space for all things introversion in the developer world. We'll have stories, tips and advise from developers from all walks of life.

If you'd like to write for the blog [please see our instructions on how to contribute](https://github.com/theintdev/theintdev.github.io/blob/master/README.md).
